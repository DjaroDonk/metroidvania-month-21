Grapple guy: I see you have found my grapple hook.
Grapple guy: That sure takes me back to my younger days.
- How do you use it?
	Grapple guy: Dunno! I spent my youth trying to figure it out.
	Grapple guy: The instructions said "press shift when close to a ceiling"
	Grapple guy: Whatever the heck that means...
	- Weird. Did they say anything else?
		Watch out for spikey ceilings.
		Press up to shorten your rope length.
		And uhhhh... Have fun!
